    The column chart on mobile-phone subscriptions above shows a striking  contrast between those developing countries and developed 
 countries in the past decade. Since 2004, people in growing numbers in developing countries use mobile phone, while those in developed countries 
 far lag behind. By 2008, there are 4 billion mobile-phone users in developing countries, which is 3 times more than that in developed 
 countries.
　　Two reasons may contribute to the contrast above. On the one hand, with the rapid increase in economy of developing countries, 
  the telecommunication industry there surges to meet the demand of globalization. Therefore, mobile phone users grows at an incredible 
  speed. On the other hand, developed countries had reached a state of prosperity in economy, and created less rooms for further 
  developments in mobile subscriptions. Maybe that is the reason why the number mobile phone users in the developed countries keep 
  even over the last decade.
　　To sum up, mobile phone is convenient for interpersonal communications, and gradually become the indispensable tools in people's life.
  When enjoying the convenience of cell phones, we should also keep an eye on the negative effects it might bring to our environment. 
  Only in this way can people in developing countries see a sustainable grow in telecommunications.
